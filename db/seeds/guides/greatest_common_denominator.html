    </h4>
    <p>
        The normal method is to find the biggest of all factors of each numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, <b>6</b>, 12.
    </p>
    <p>
        The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, <b>6</b>, 9, 18.
    </p>
    <p>
        The greatest common factor is <b>6</b>.

    <p>
        Sometimes the smaller number divides into the big number. In this case, the GCD is <b>14</b>.
