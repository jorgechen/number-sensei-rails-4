# Number Sensei

Number Sensei, aka #Sensei, is a direct result of the lack of engaging software for extracurricular math in American K-12 education. 

When I tried math club in high school, it was nigh impossible to understand the content because it was very disorganized, very disengaging, and very hard for mere humans to read. As a result, I was allergic to mental math despite loving it dearly before age 10. Now I am back with a vengeance to rectify this grievous problem.

Our content is based on the Number Sense, Mathematics, and similar competitions that are popular in Texas schools.
